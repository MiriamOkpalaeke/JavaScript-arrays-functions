// question (1a), What are the differences between mutating array methods and non-mutation array methods in JavaScript. 
/* Mutating array method  is basically changing the array itself instead of returning a new array with the new changes.
** Non-Mutating array method is returning a whole new array which has all the changes.

*/
//List 5 array methods that fall under each of them.
/* Mutating we have;  array.push(), array.shift(), array.sort(), array.splice() and array.unshift().
** Non-mutating we have; array.concat(), array.includes(), array.indexOf, , array.slice(), array.toString()
